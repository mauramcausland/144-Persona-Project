relationship between volleyball stats

![Hitting vs Win%](144-PDP-Graph.png)
**Figure 1.** This scatterplot shows the relationship between each Division I volleyball team's win percentage and their team hitting percentage ((#kills - #errors)/total attempts). Each point represents a team, with a color legend for number of hitting errors made by a team. The visualization suggests a positive association: teams with higher win percentages tend to have a higher hitting percentage. However, with the gradient legend, you can see that teams who make more hitting errors tend to have a higher win percentages. This could be due to those teams playing more sets, more chances to make errors, or those teams are willing to take more risks with swings leading to higher error but also higher kills. This supports the intuition that strong offensive performance (more successful attacks) contributes to overall team success.
